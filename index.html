        	I am a college student who is excited about the new course Web Programing. My major is Electronic Design of Multimedia. I am interested in web design and print making. I have a lot of dreams, such as becoming wealthy, traveling around the world. I love art and craft. My like to say I am so sleepy. Also, I like to sing "we are gonna die young". To me, the worst thing of the world is to wake up. I never satisfy the hours I sleep. I think alarm is my enemy, and I hate it. It keeps to disturb my dreams and annoys me. I am a healthy girl that having an apple every day. If one of my wish can come true, I hope it is to get rid of my black rims, because I am not a panda.
